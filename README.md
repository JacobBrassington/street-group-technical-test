## Street Group Technical Test

### Timeline
All in all this technical test took me about 1h 10m

### AI Usage
I used AI twice, once to get the regex and second to test my json output for any mistakes.

I used as little AI as was reasonable due to it being a technical test, if it was not, I would have used more and then 
spent time cleaning up the code, probably would have halved the time required. And used it to write tests from my notes at the top of the service class.

### Assumptions Made
There are 2 assumptions I made here around the output since there was nothing specified explicitly, although both could be archived with minimal effort.
- I did not change "Mister" -> "Mr" and such.
- I did not remove the full-stop after the initial if required.

I could have done both of these if it was required, but was not sure.

### What I could or would have done given more time.
- Frontend, although VueJS is part of this job it was not part of the ticket, so almost no time was up into the frontend. If this is a concern, I can go back and do this.
- Automated testing, for something like this tests would have been perfect, and probably done first in a TDD fashion, but given the timeline chose not to.
- Added form requests, although I made a presumption that the end user would not attempt to break it (perhaps falsely)
